# Game Instructions

## Main Instructions
1. You should pick as many rupees as you can until de majoras mask appears.
2. 2. If the masks touch you two dragon would be summoned and you will have to fight them.

## Game Controls
1. Move Forward = Right Key (Keyboard).
2. Move Backward = Left Key (Keyboard).
3. Jump = Up Key (Keyboard).

## Battle Scene(Second Scene)
1. Select Dragon to Attack = Left Key (Keyboard)
2. To Attack = Space Bar (Keyboard)

## Design Process
This game was designed on an initial, quite complex, webpack configuration specific for Phaser3. This allowed me to investigate Phaser and its tools from a specific perspective. The entire game was build based on phaser [making your first game tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1) and [Zenva How to Create a Turn-Based RPG in Phaser 3](https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-create-a-turn-based-rpg-game-in-phaser-3-part-1/) tutorials.

The player can move around the map and jump using the arrow keys. The idea is to get as many rupees as possible to get the most points, each time the player gets touched by the enemy he will be spawned at a different scenario and a battle between the player and 2 dragons will begin.
